Feature: Campaign throttling

  Background:
    Given the following campaigns exist:
      | preferred | throttle | banners |
      | normal    | 60       | one     |
      | low       | 100      | two     |

  Scenario: Throttled banner has higher priority
    Given I roll 0.59 for banner choice
    Then I see banner one

  Scenario: Throttled banner yields some allocations
    Given I roll 0.61 for banner choice
    Then I see banner two
