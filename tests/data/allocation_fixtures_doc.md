TODO update the following note
In the allocation fixture data, times are represented as offsets in days from the
current time. When the fixtures are loaded, these are converted to UNIX
timestamps (the format used by the code being tested).

TODO mention: for non-geotargetted, countries prop is filled in as blank

TODO mention: some default properties that are set (autolink, landingPage,
dummy banner body)
